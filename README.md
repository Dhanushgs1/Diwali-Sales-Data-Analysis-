Date: Date of the sale
Sales: Sales amount for that date
Product: Type of product sold
User_ID: ID of the user/customer
Cust_name: Name of the customer
Product_ID: ID of the product
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age Group: Categorized age group of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Marital_Status: Marital status of the customer
State: State information
Zone: Geographical zone
Occupation: Customer's occupation
Product_Category: Category of the product
Orders: Number of orders made
Amount: Sales amount
Status: Status of the order
Unnamed1: Additional column (if available)
Tools Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running Python code, data visualization, and analysis
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Library for numerical operations and array manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization
Analysis Steps
Data Loading: Loading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Checking for missing values, handling inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and initial insights.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, or pie charts to illustrate sales trends, popular products, or any other relevant patterns.
Conclusions: Summarize the findings and key insights obtained from the analysis.
Files Included
diwali_sales_data.csv: Raw dataset used for analysis
diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis
